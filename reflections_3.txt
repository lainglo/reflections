14) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you are working on one project via multiple machines, or with multiple people.

15) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

There might be clashes that you only want to deal with once you are finished developing a certain feature or piece of code.
You might be developing your own personal version of the program in which case you would not want to pull any changes from the remote.

16) Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Branches are part of a repository.
Clones are copies of repositories that are linked remotely back to the original repository from which they were copied.
Forks are copies of github repositories, within github, and are different to clones since there is no remote to the original added. If a forked repository is cloned to a local repo, then it becomes the origin.

17) What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

Master and origin/master can be merged at any time (providing the code has not diverged too much).

18) How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Alternative to GitHub would be to share files through a program like dropbox.
It would be more difficult to pick up changes in updated versions of the files, and hence it would be more difficult to resolve any conflicts.
I am not sure what would be easier in this situation.
