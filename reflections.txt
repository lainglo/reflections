1) How did viewing a diff between two versions help you spot the bug?

It drew immediate attention to possible lines that could contain the bug. After that it was just a process of elimination.

2) What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

pro's:
More meaningful purpose behind each version
easier to find bugs/differences between versions

con's:
easy to forget to save

3) Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Google docs for example, only saves the document that is currently being worked on. 
Git does not see files as being separate - it tracks changes universally between commits unless otherwise told.

4) How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log - will show you history of commits, or a subset thereof if a search function is used
git diff - will compare 2 different versions of files and can help to pick up differences.

5) How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

since it would be much easier to fix them or restore a previous working version than without version control.

6) Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

Improve efficiency during software development.
