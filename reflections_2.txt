7) What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

The git program creates a file that records all the commits recorded in the repo from that point on.
Unless the repo is initialized, you just have a normal folder.

8) How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area allows for changes to be tracked without being committed. It allows us a chance to stop tracking a file if we choose not to commit.

9) How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

By only committing one file that has been altered at a time. In the case of multiple files being linked to one logical change, more than 1 file can be committed from the staging area.
